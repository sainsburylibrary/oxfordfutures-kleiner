The requirements for a more suitable consultancy methodology are stated. An approach called  'Modelling As Learning' is introduced, its three defining aspects being: client ownership of all analytical work performed, consultant acting as facilitator and sensitivity to soft issues within and surrounding a problem. The goal of such an approach is set as the acceleration of the client's learning about the business. The tools that are used within this methodological framework are discussed and some case studies of the methodology are presented. It is argued that a learning experience was necessary before arriving at the new methodology but that it is now a valuable and significant compontent of the division's work.''},
