As a result of ``technological breakthroughs and a cycle of good weather worldwide in the 1990's ... the world system of the 1970's'' was restored, although ``The new system ... was more centralized, more highly regulated, and more authoritarian that that of 25 years earlier.''.},

This was achieved ``through the gradual withering of the industrial state and ... acceptance of more frugal life styles.''
