The requirements for a more suitable consultancy methodology are stated. An approach called  'Modelling As Learning' is introduced, its three defining aspects being: client ownership of all analytical work performed, consultant acting as facilitator and sensitivity to soft issues within and surrounding a problem. The goal of such an approach is set as the acceleration of the client's learning about the business. The tools that are used within this methodological framework are discussed and some case studies of the methodology are presented. It is argued that a learning experience was necessary before arriving at the new methodology but that it is now a valuable and significant component of the division's work.''"},

The author also offers an alternative scenario in which ``crude oil prices remain constant in real terms or decline slightly until 1990''. The second letter, by Jerry McAfee, Chairman of the Board at Gulf Oil Company, argues that ``André Bénard's discussion of the world oil market and its past and future effects on economic growth are very perceptive and realistic'' and that ``the ability of the United States and other developed countries of the world to prosper under either of Bénard's scenarios is improving.''"},
