The second, ``A Few Facts About Using Oil Efficiently'' looks at ways in which extracting oil from the ANWR is less efficient than alternative measures. The third part outlines five areas regarding the US Interior Department's proposals for oil leasing in the ANWR: ``How they [the US Interior Department] assumed ridiculous oil prices'', ``How they further inflated oil-finding prospects by five-fold'', ``How they ''found`` twice the oil the State of Alaska did'', ``How they stretched the ''benefits`` out of proportion'' and ``How they exaggerated the importance of the oil''.},
